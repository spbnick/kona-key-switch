Hyundai Kona Electric Key Fob Kill Switch
=========================================

This is a 3D model for a kill switch for a Hyundai Kona Electric Key Fob.
It works in conjunction with [Battereed][battereed]. The switch can be used
to disable the key fob and protect the car from relay theft, and is an
alternative to using protective pouches/metal cans.
